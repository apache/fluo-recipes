   * Must be able to handle same key being exported multiple times and key being exported out of
   * order. The sequence number is meant to help with this.
   *
   * <p>
   * If multiple export entries with the same key are passed in, then the entries with the same key
   * will be consecutive and in ascending sequence order.
   *
   * <p>
   * If the call to process exports is unexpectedly terminated, it will be called again later with
   * at least the same data. For example suppose an exporter was passed the following entries.
   *
   * <ul>
   * <li>key=0 sequence=9 value=abc
   * <li>key=1 sequence=13 value=d
   * <li>key=1 sequence=17 value=e
   * <li>key=1 sequence=23 value=f
   * <li>key=2 sequence=19 value=x
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>
   * Assume the exporter exports some of these and then fails before completing all of them. The
   * next time its called it will be passed what it saw before, but it could also be passed more.
   *
   * <ul>
   * <li>key=0 sequence=9 value=abc
   * <li>key=1 sequence=13 value=d
   * <li>key=1 sequence=17 value=e
   * <li>key=1 sequence=23 value=f
   * <li>key=1 sequence=29 value=g
   * <li>key=2 sequence=19 value=x
   * <li>key=2 sequence=77 value=y
